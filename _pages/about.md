My main Research agenda in that last years has been on **Foundation Models for AGI** (Artificial General Intelligence) with focus on **Autonomy and Agency** and can be summarized in three pillars:

- **Cognitive Architectures (LLM + Prompt-Engine + Memory-Engine)**
- **Digital AGI (Skill Learning / Decision making / Tool Usage)**
- **Embodied Intelligence / Robot Learning**

While I find a path towards funding for my AGI Research, I try to create profitable solutions in real-world optimal control applications spanning from autonomous systems to data center energy optimization. In particular involved on the adaptation / finetuning of Large Language Models with human inductive bias in the loop (AI alignment).
