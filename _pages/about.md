My main Research agenda in that last years has been on **Foundation Models for AGI** (Artificial General Intelligence) with focus on **Autonomy and Agency** and can be summarized in three pillars:

- **Cognitive Architectures (LLM + Prompt-Engine + Memory-Engine)**
- **Digital AGI (Skill Learning / Decision making / Tool Usage)**
- **Embodied Intelligence / Robot Learning**

While I find a path towards funding for my AGI Research, I try to create profitable solutions in real-world optimal control applications spanning from autonomous systems to data center energy optimization. In particular involved on the adaptation / finetuning of Large Language Models with human inductive bias in the loop (AI alignment).

Experience
======
<i class="fas fa-building" aria-hidden="true"></i> AI Researcher (2023-Present)
: Vatic Labs
: I decided to join Vatic Labs to focus on AGI for quantitative finance challenges.

<i class="fas fa-building" aria-hidden="true"></i> Researcher (2021-2023)
: Azure AI Research
: I supported Research in AI Alignment with RLHF / RLFAI (Reinforcement Learning from Human or AI Feedback). In 2021, I also supported the Azure Personalizer Service (contextual bandits for Personalization / Recommendations). 

<i class="fas fa-building" aria-hidden="true"></i> Research Engineer / Researcher (2019-2023)
: Microsoft Research

: I collaborated with other MSR Researchers, focusing on the Embodied Intelligence pillar, trying to design system with reliable Offline pretraining (through Offline RL, Meta-RL and other interactive representation learning methods) and downstream finetuning, involving Skill learning and discovering for fast online adaptation.

<i class="fas fa-building" aria-hidden="true"></i> Research Engineer (2019-2021)
: Microsoft Research

: I was a Research Engineer in the Cloud Efficiency group, where contributed to several “Self-driving datacenter” scenarios on Resource Central (ML prediction-serving System for Azure).

<i class="fas fa-building" aria-hidden="true"></i> Software Engineer (2017-2019)
: Azure Data AI

: Worked on Automatic Configuration Tuning for PostgreSQL DBMS using Deep Reinforcement Learning and SKU recommendation system (best tier/size configuration) of Azure SQL Database to accommodate on-premises workloads

Education
======
<i class="fas fa-graduation-cap" aria-hidden="true"></i>  MSc in Image, Vision and Machine Learning (2014-2017)
: École Polytechnique (France)

: **Dissertation:** Using Machine Learning to build P300-based Brain Computer Interfaces for Gaming 

<i class="fas fa-graduation-cap" aria-hidden="true"></i>  BSc Computer Software Engineering (2011-2016)
: Instituto Tecnológico de Aeronáutica (Brazil)

: **Dissertation:** A Framework for games controlled by the brain through P300 Visual Event-Related Potentials

<i class="fas fa-graduation-cap" aria-hidden="true"></i> Medical School (2008-2011)
: University of Brasília (Brazil) 

: I also studied three years of MedSchool, when I spent some time studying the Brain, Human Intelligence and Cognitive Sciences, from where I try to get inspiration and inductive biases for modeling AI agents.
