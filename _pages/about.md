I am a Research Scientist with a solid background in Software Engineering and an uncoventional path to Research. More recently, I have been involved with RL for LLMs (RLHF / RLAIF) and AI Alignment as well as the next generation of LLM-based Agents in the OpenAI models team at Azure AI Research.

I received my Master’s Degree in Image, Vision and Machine Learning in a double degree program between ITA(opens in new tab) (Brazil) and École Polytechnique(opens in new tab) (France).

In previous teams at Microsoft, I worked with Knowledge and Language – Cognitive Services Research group. And in Microsoft Research (MSR), as a Research Engineer, working with the Cloud Efficiency group(opens in new tab), where I contributed to several “Self-driving datacenter” scenarios through the Resource Central(opens in new tab) platform (ML prediction-serving System for Azure).

Research
======
My main Research agenda in that last years has been on **Foundation Models for AGI** (Artificial General Intelligence) with focus on **Autonomy and Agency** and can be summarized in three pillars:

- **Cognitive Architectures (LLM + Prompt-Engine + Memory-Engine)**
- **Digital AGI (Skill Learning / Decision making / Tool Usage)**
- **Embodied Intelligence / Robot Learning**

While I find a path towards funding for my AGI Research, I try to create profitable solutions in real-world optimal control applications spanning from autonomous systems to data center energy optimization. In particular involved on the adaptation / finetuning of Large Language Models with human inductive bias in the loop (AI alignment).

News and Updates
======
- 2023.10: I will be in [ICCV](https://iccv2023.thecvf.com/) presenting [HoloAssist](https://holoassist.github.io/). Stop by to chat!

Contact
======
If you are interested in Cognitive Architectures augmenting LLMs with a Pre-frontal Cortex and External Memory with focus on Multi-modality, Embodiment and Skill Learning, please ping me.
