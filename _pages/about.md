My main Research agenda in that last years has been on **Foundation Models for AGI** (Artificial General Intelligence) with focus on **Autonomy and Agency** and can be summarized in three pillars:

**- Cognitive Architectures (LLM + Prompt-Engine + Memory-Engine)**
**- Digital AGI (Skill Learning / Decision making / Tool Usage)**
**- Embodied Intelligence / Robot Learning**

While I find a path towards funding for my AGI Research, I try to create profitable solutions in real-world optimal control applications spanning from autonomous systems to data center energy optimization. In particular involved on the adaptation / finetuning of Large Language Models with human inductive bias in the loop (AI alignment).

From 2021-2023, I was a  Research Scientist in the Azure AI Research team. I support Research in AI Alignment with RLHF / RLFAI (Reinforcement Learning from Human or AI Feedback). I also supported the Azure Personalizer Service (contextual bandits for Personalization / Recommendations). 

In the Embodied Intelligence pillar in collaboration with MSR, the efforts are on trying to design system with reliable Offline pretraining (through Offline RL, Meta-RL and other interactive representation learning methods) and downstream finetuning, involving Skill learning and discovering for fast online adaptation.

Previously, from 2019-2021, I was a Research Engineer in the Cloud Efficiency group, where contributed to several “Self-driving datacenter” scenarios on Resource Central (ML prediction-serving System for Azure).

I received my Master’s Degree in Image, Vision and Machine Learning in a double degree program between ITA (Brazil) and École Polytechnique (France).

I also studied three years of MedSchool in the University of Brasília (Brazil), when I spent some time studying the Brain, Human Intelligence and Cognitive Sciences, from where I try to get inspiration and inductive biases for modeling AI agents.
