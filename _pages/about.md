I am a Research Scientist in the Azure Cognitive Services Research team. I support Research in AI Alignment / RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) and previously the Azure Personalizer Service (contextual bandits for Personalization / Recommendations). 

My main Research agenda in collaboration with MSR has been on pretraining of Foundation models for AGI with focus on decision making and Embodied AI / Robot Learning.

While I find a path towards funding for my AGI Research, I try to create profitable solutions in real-world optimal control applications spanning from autonomous systems to data center energy optimization. In particular involved on the adaptation / finetuning of Large Language Models with human inductive bias in the loop (AI alignment).

In the Embodied Intelligence pillar, the efforts are on trying to design system with reliable Offline pretraining (through Offline RL, Meta-RL and other interactive representation learning methods) and downstream finetuning, involving Skill learning and discovering for fast online adaptation.

Previously, I was a Research Engineer in the Cloud Efficiency group, where contributed to several “Self-driving datacenter” scenarios on Resource Central (ML prediction-serving System for Azure).

I received my Master’s Degree in Image, Vision and Machine Learning in a double degree program between ITA (Brazil) and École Polytechnique (France).

I also studied three years of MedSchool in the University of Brasília (Brazil), when I spent some time studing the Brain, Human Intelligence and Cognitive Sciences, from where I try to get inspiration and inductive biases for modeling AI agents.
