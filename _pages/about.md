I work currently as an Applied Scientist in the Cognitive Services team (Decision AI) where I support the Azure Personalizer Service (contextual bandits for Personalization / Recommendations). 

My main Research agenda in collaboration with Microsoft Research is focused on pretraining of Foundation models for decision making and Embodied AI / Robot Learning.

While I find a path towards funding for my AGI Research, I try to create profitable solutions in real-world optimal control applications spanning from robotics / autonomous systems to data center energy optimization. In particular, I am focusing on the online adaptation of Large Language Models with human inductive bias in the loop (AI alignment).

In the Embodied Intelligence pillar, the focus is on Offline pretraining (through Offline RL, Meta-RL and other interactive representation learning methods) and downstream finetuning, involving Skill learning and descovering.

Previously, I was a Research Software Engineer in the Cloud Efficiency group, where I focused on Resource Central (ML prediction-serving System for Azure).

I received my Master’s Degree in Image, Vision and Machine Learning in a double degree program between ITA (Brazil) and École Polytechnique (France).
I also studied three years of MedSchool in the University of Brasília (Brazil), when I started to get fascinated by the Brain, Human Intelligence and Cognitive Sciences, from where I try to get inspiration for modeling AI agents.
