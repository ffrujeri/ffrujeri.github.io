I am currently an Applied Scientist in the Cognitive Services team (Decision AI) where I support the Azure Personalizer Service (contextual bandits for Personalization / Recommendations) and my main Research agenda in collaboration with Microsoft Research is around Foundation models for Embodied AI / Robot Learning.

I am generally interested in real-world optimal control applications spanning from robotics / autonomous systems to data center energy optimization. In particular, I am focusing on Offline pretraining (through Offline RL or other methods) and downstream finetuning.

Previously, I was a Research Software Engineer in the Cloud Efficiency group, where I focused on Resource Central (ML prediction-serving System for Azure).

I received my Master’s Degree in Image, Vision and Machine Learning in a double degree program between ITA (Brazil) and École Polytechnique (France).
