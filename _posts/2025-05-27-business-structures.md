## Tax Benefits

The most common way to get tax deductions is by using the funds you've invested to cover legitimate business expenses. 

These expenses can then be deducted on the S-corp's tax return (Form 1120-S). Some examples of deductible business expenses include:
- Rent or mortgage interest
- Utilities
- Phone expenses
- Insurance
- Depreciation of equipment and home office (if applicable)
- Salaries and wages paid to employees (including yourself)
- Business-related travel, meals, and entertainment

## [Basis Limitations in S-Corporations](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/s-corporation-stock-and-debt-basis)

Basis limitations are a key rule for S-corporation shareholders, determining the maximum amount of losses and deductions they can claim on their individual tax returns.

- When an S-corporation experiences losses, these losses "pass through" to the shareholders to be reported on their personal tax returns.

- However, the basis limitation prevents shareholders from deducting losses exceeding their investment (basis) in the S-corporation.

- This limitation prevents shareholders from deducting more than they have invested in the business, protecting the government from excessive tax deductions


## How is basis determined?
Your basis in an S-corporation includes your stock basis and your debt basis.
Stock basis: This includes your initial capital contributions to the corporation.
Debt basis: This includes direct loans you've made to the S-corporation.
Important note: Loans guaranteed by the shareholder, but not made directly to the corporation, do not increase debt basis.


### Law
The basis limitations for S-corporation shareholders are primarily governed by Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 1366(d)(1). This section states that a shareholder's aggregate amount of losses and deductions cannot exceed the sum of: 
- The shareholder's adjusted basis in their S-corporation stock.
- The shareholder's adjusted basis in any indebtedness of the S-corporation to the shareholder. 

### What happens to losses exceeding basis?
Losses that cannot be deducted in the current year due to basis limitations are suspended. These suspended losses are carried over to future years and can be deducted when the shareholder's basis increases.

If a shareholder disposes of their stock while suspended losses exist, those losses are permanently lost. 

### Other Loss Limitations:
It's important to remember that the basis limitation is just one of several loss limitations that apply to S-corporation shareholders. Other limitations include: 
- At-Risk Limitations (IRC Section 465): These limits prevent deductions exceeding the amount a taxpayer is personally "at risk" of losing.

- Passive Activity Loss (PAL) Limitations (IRC Section 469): These rules limit the deduction of losses from passive activities (like rental properties) against non-passive income.

- Excess Business Loss Limitation (IRC Section 461(l)): This limitation applies to non-corporate taxpayers and restricts the amount of current-year business losses that can be deducted. 

- These limitations are applied in a specific order: basis limitations first, followed by at-risk limits, then passive activity loss rules, and finally the excess business loss limitation
