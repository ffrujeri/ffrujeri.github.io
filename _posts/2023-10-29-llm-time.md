- How to effectively tokenize time series data
  - proper tokenization is extremely important
  - the most common tokenization method is byte-pair encoding (BPE), which treats inputs as bit strings and assign tokens based on the rate of ocurrence in the training corpus, optimizing for shorter sequeces of tokens on average.
- Convert discrete distributions over tokens into highly flexible densities over continuous values
- Handle missing data without imputation through non-numerical text
- Alignment intervention (RLHF) might worsen performance
