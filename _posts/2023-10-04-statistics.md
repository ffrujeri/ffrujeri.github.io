## Simple linear regression model
We are now ready to summarize the four conditions that comprise "the simple linear regression model:"

**L**inear Function: The mean of the response, $\mbox{E}(Y_i)$ at each value of the predictor $x_i$ is a Linear function of the $x_i$.

**I**ndependent: The errors, $\epsilon_{i}$, are Independent. 
**N**ormally Distributed: The errors, $\epsilon_{i}$, at each value of the predictor, $x_i$, are Normally distributed.
**E**qual variances (denoted $\sigma^{2}$): The errors, $\epsilon_{i}$, at each value of the predictor, $x_i$, have Equal variances.

An equivalent way to think of the first (linearity) condition is that the mean of the error, $\mbox{E}(\epsilon_i)$, at each value of the predictor, $x_i$, is *zero*. An alternative way to describe all four assumptions is that the errors, $\epsilon_{i}$, are independent normal random variables with mean zero and constant variance, $\sigma^{2}$.
