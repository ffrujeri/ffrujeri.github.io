Imagine trying to devour a whole cake in one bite. Itâ€™s not only impractical but also overwhelming. 

1. Cognitive Load and Comprehension

Human cognitive abilities have limits. When faced with a massive wall of text, our brains struggle to process and retain information effectively. By breaking down the text into manageable chunks we can mimic the natural way humans consume information, reducing cognitive load and enhancing comprehension.

Text chunking facilitates better contextual understanding. Instead of treating the entire document as a single entity, breaking it into smaller chunks enables us capture nuances and relationships within specific segments of the text.
