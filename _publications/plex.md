excerpt: "<img src='/images/dote.png' style='display:block; margin:auto;'><br/>Many resource management problems require sequential decision-making under uncertainty, where the only uncertainty affecting the decision outcomes are exogenous variables outside the control of the decision-maker. We model these problems as Exo-MDPs (Markov Decision Processes with Exogenous Inputs) and design a class of data-efficient algorithms for them termed Hindsight Learning (HL). Our HL algorithms achieve data efficiency by leveraging a key insight: having samples of the exogenous variables, past decisions can be revisited in hindsight to infer counterfactual consequences that can accelerate policy improvements. We compare HL against classic baselines in the multi-secretary and airline revenue management problems. We also scale our algorithms to a business-critical cloud resource management problem — allocating Virtual Machines (VMs) to physical machines, and simulate their performance with real datasets from a large public cloud provider. We find that HL algorithms outperform domain-specific heuristics, as well as state-of-the-art reinforcement learning methods."

A rich representation is key to general robotic manipulation, but existing model architectures require a lot of data to learn it. Unfortunately, ideal robotic manipulation training data, which comes in the form of expert visuomotor demonstrations for a variety of annotated tasks, is scarce. In this work we propose PLEX, a transformer-based architecture that learns from task-agnostic visuomotor trajectories accompanied by a much larger amount of task-conditioned object manipulation videos — a type of robotics-relevant data available in quantity. The key insight behind PLEX is that the trajectories with observations and actions help induce a latent feature space and train a robot to execute task-agnostic manipulation routines, while a diverse set of video-only demonstrations can efficiently teach the robot how to plan in this feature space for a wide variety of tasks. In contrast to most works on robotic manipulation pretraining, PLEX learns a generalizable sensorimotor multi-task policy, not just an observational representation. We also show that using relative positional encoding in PLEX’s transformers further increases its data efficiency when learning from human-collected demonstrations. Experiments showcase PLEX’s generalization on Meta-World-v2 benchmark and establish state-of-the-art performance in challenging Robosuite environments.
